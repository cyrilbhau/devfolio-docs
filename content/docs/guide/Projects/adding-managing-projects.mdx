# 💪 Adding and Managing Your Existing Projects

## Adding a Project

Follow these steps to add a project to your Devfolio profile:

1. Head over to [My Projects](https://devfolio.co/my-projects).
2. Click on **“Add a Project.”**
3. Choose whether you're adding the project for a hackathon or as a side project.

<Callout type="info" title="Active Hackathons">
If you see an option to link the project to an ongoing hackathon, it means the submission window is open and you're enrolled in one.  
If not, either the hackathon submission period is closed, or you're not participating in any currently active hackathon.
</Callout>
