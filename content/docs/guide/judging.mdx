## Judging Mode

Devfolio offers three modes of Judging:

- **Online Judging**: For online hackathons.
- **Offline Judging**: For In Real Life (IRL) hackathons.
- **Sponsor Judging**: For sponsor tracks.

## Judging Criteria

Projects are evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Technicality**: Is the project functional? Does it justify the hackathon duration?
- **Originality**: How innovative is the project? Does it bring a fresh perspective or solution?
- **Practicality**: Is the project useful and accessible (Mobile App, Web App, Desktop Application)?
- **Aesthetics**: How is the UI/UX of the project? Is it intuitive and user-friendly?
- **Wow Factor**: Does the project have a unique aspect that makes it stand out, even if it lacks in other criteria?

## Prerequisites for Judges

- A laptop (as the judging will be done on Devfolio).
- A Devfolio account. Follow these steps:

  - If you **do not have a Devfolio account**:

    - Visit [devfolio.co/signup](https://devfolio.co/signup) and sign up using the email ID on which you received the judging invite.

  - If you **already have an account**:
    - Ensure you're logged in with the same email ID used for the judging invite.
