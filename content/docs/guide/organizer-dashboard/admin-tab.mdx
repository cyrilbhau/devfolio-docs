## 🔍 Search Team and Hackers

All relevant data of hackers is visible through the dashboard itself.

<Callout title="Sensitive Data Access" type="warning">
  Certain sensitive information such as phone numbers is visible upon entering the username of the hacker in the search bar, which is why <strong>access to this tab must be provided with discretion</strong>.

You can also extend the RSVP deadline for a specific user by X number of days or hours. This is useful when a user misses the RSVP deadline after being accepted but you still want them to attend.

## 📢 Make an Announcement

The Admin tab also lets you send announcements to hackers — to keep them informed about updates or changes. When clicking on ‘Preview’, a checkbox will appear that allows the announcement to also be sent via email.
