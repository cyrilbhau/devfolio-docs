## Online Mode

In `Online` mode, you can see a list of hackers with their respective status. You can filter out the list by Country or City depending on the nature of your request.

The **status of the applicant** can be:

- `Profile Submitted`: They have only applied to your hackathon  
- `Project Submitted`: They have applied as well as submitted their project to your hackathon

## Offline and Online with Application Review Mode

Here, you can review individual and team profiles to extend invitations to them to attend your hackathon (accept), decline their application (reject), or waitlist (apply/reject later) them. You can apply various filters to help you in the process.
