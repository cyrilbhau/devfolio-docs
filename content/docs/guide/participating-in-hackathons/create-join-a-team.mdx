## Online hackathon

<Callout type="info">
You can create or join the team anytime during the hackathon (optional for individual hackers).
</Callout>

### Creating and joining a team

1. For online hackathons on Devfolio, even if you're submitting a project individually, ensure you form a team prior to your submission.
2. You have the flexibility to create or join a team at any point before submitting your project, as detailed above.
3. When you submit your profile as part of a team, we take the strength of the entire team into consideration and not just the strength of individual profiles. Sometimes, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Offline + Online With Application Review hackathon

<Callout type="info">
You can create or join a team while submitting your profile for review or after getting individually verified. Team formation is compulsory here!
</Callout>

### Creating a Team

1. It's advisable to apply individually and, upon acceptance to the hackathon, proceed to create or join a team.

### Joining a Team

### Edge Case

If you're currently submitting an application and wish to join a team that's already in an `accepted` status, you will not be able to do so. However, you can submit your application as an individual. Once accepted, you'll then have the opportunity to join the team.
