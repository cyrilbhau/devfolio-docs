## ⏱️ Steps to Report a Project on Devfolio

1. A project can be reported for plagiarism, recycling, or inappropriate/offensive content.

2. The project builders can make their case against the report by replying to DevfolioBot’s comment on their Project Page.

3. If Devfolio’s Content & Moderation team finds the report valid, the said project will be publicly flagged on the platform.

4. Other builders can support the flagged team or the reporting team by replying or upvoting/downvoting existing comments.
