## 📌 What is RSVP?

RSVP (short for _Répondez s'il vous plaît_, or “please respond” in French) is a confirmation step that helps organizers ensure serious commitment from accepted participants. When you RSVP, you're officially confirming your attendance at the hackathon.

---

## 🎯 Why Do Hackathons Require RSVP?

RSVP helps organizers:

- Plan resources (space, food, mentors)
- Avoid no-shows
- Make room for waitlisted participants
- Ensure a smoother hackathon experience for all

---

## 📋 The RSVP Process

After you're accepted into a hackathon, you’re still not fully confirmed until you RSVP.  

This second layer of confirmation helps:

- Filter out people who are no longer interested
- Lock in committed attendees

---

## 🚫 What Happens If You Don’t RSVP?

If you miss the RSVP deadline:

- Your spot may go to someone on the waitlist
- You may lose access to project submission or event check-in
- You may miss out on swag, perks, or team formation

---

## ⏰ Understanding RSVP Deadlines

Most hackathons set RSVP deadlines a few weeks before the event to:

- Finalize the participant list
- Adjust resources
- Notify waitlisted applicants
- Prep for team formation
- Arrange logistics like check-in kits or travel

---

## ✅ What Happens After You RSVP?

Once you RSVP:

- You’ll get a confirmation email
- You’ll be looped into pre-hackathon communications
- You'll receive access to schedules, team info, and updates
- You may be invited to exclusive pre-event activities

---

## ❌ Cancellation & Changes

If you need to cancel:

- Notify the organizers ASAP
- Your spot may go to someone on the waitlist
- You help ensure a better experience for everyone

---

## 💡 Best Practices

To stay on top of things:

- Check your email often
- RSVP as soon as you can
