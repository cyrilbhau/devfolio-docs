# 🧑‍💻 Start Your Devfolio Hacker Experience Here

## Getting Started with Devfolio: A Complete Guide

This guide outlines the key activities and processes for hackers using the Devfolio platform. While Devfolio offers access to hackathons and events all year round, your experience as a hacker will be broadly divided into three main phases:

- Pre-hackathon preparation
- Hackathon participation
- Post-hackathon activities

Each phase links out to specific pages to help you navigate the process.

### ⬅️ Pre-Hackathon Phase

The pre-hackathon phase focuses on platform familiarization and account setup. Complete these essential steps before participating in hackathons:

Your profile serves as your digital portfolio on Devfolio. Include relevant technical skills, achievements, and hackathon experiences. A comprehensive profile increases your chances of hackathon acceptance.

If you're participating in a Web3 hackathon, we also recommend [connecting your Ethereum wallet](../linking-your-ethereum-wallet.md) for stake-to-participate hackathons and prize distribution.
