description: Add a project to showcase on your Devfolio profile 🌟

Devfolio, as you may have noticed, is a portmanteau of two words: **Developer** and **Portfolio**.  
We envision ourselves as a platform developers can use to showcase their past work to anyone interested — be it a hiring manager or a fellow builder.

The best way to do this, apart from creating [your profile](../your-devfolio-profile.md), is to add projects.

Your **Projects** section is where you can highlight your side projects, hobby work, open source contributions, or anything else you’ve built.  
Hackathon projects submitted through Devfolio will automatically appear on your profile, but you’re encouraged to manually add others too!

## ✨ Adding a Project

Follow these steps to add a project to your Devfolio profile:

1. Visit [https://devfolio.co/my-projects](https://devfolio.co/my-projects)
2. Click on **Add a Project**
3. Choose whether you’re submitting it for a hackathon or just as a side project.

<Callout type="info">
  If you see the option to submit to a hackathon, it's because the platform detects you're part of an active one.  
  If not, the submission window may be closed or you may not be registered for any hackathons.
